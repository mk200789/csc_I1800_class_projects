Program 1: Euclidean MTSP


MTSP stands for Traveling Salesperson Problem with multiple sales people.  In the "ordinary" TSP there are n cities. A single sales person is to find a tour that passes through each city once and only once and  his or her  tour is to be minimal in cost. Generally,  costs are provided in a cost matrix. In the Euclidean TSP costs are taken to be Euclidean distance in the plane.  In our instance, costs are assumed to be symmetric, i.e. Cij = Cji for all i,j. In the MTSP there are m different sales people and each city is to be visited by one and only one distinct  sales person. The  total cost is to be minimal.

In your program there are to be n = 150 cities and five sales people. The cities are to be generated using a random number generator. Solve this problem using an SA, GA, or PSO. Include a report describing your work.
